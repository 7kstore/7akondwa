<strong>A man on a journey carrying a goat, hyena and a bag of corn comes across 
a river. He needs to get all his items across the river but he can't carry all 
them at once. If he starts with the bag of corn, then the hyena will eat the 
goat behind him, if he takes the hyena, the goat will eat the corn. The man can 
only carry one or two of them at once. What does he do?</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style1">
<strong>Answer: The man takes the goat first, leaving the hyena with the bag of 
maize. He then goes back and takes the hyena across the river. He doesn't leave 
the hyena with the goat so he retakes the goat back to the other side. There he 
leaves the goat and grabs the bag of maize, crossing it to the required side. 
All items have crossed without a problem.</strong></p>
